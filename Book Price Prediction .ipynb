      " 'A layered portrait of a troubled genius for whom art was not merely a thing of beauty but a vital part of living itself.\\nSelling Points: The original Marathi book won the National Award for Best Book on Cinema (in 1986), now available for the first time in English.\\nThe Book: Guru Dutt is now named along with the masters of world cinema—like Orson Welles, Mizoguchi, Hitchcock, Jancso, Ophuls—for his innovative cinematic form and his deep humanism and compassion. In Guru Dutt: A Tragedy in Three Acts, renowned film-maker and scholar Arun Khopkar sheds new light on Dutt’s genius through a close examination of Dutt’s three best-known films—Pyaasa, Kaagaz Ke Phool and Sahib Biwi Aur Ghulam. With a nuanced eye, Khopkar explores the historical context which influenced Dutt’s deeply melancholic style while also analyzing the intricacies of the medium—acting, lighting, music, editing, rhythm—that Dutt carefully deployed to create his masterpieces. Originally written in Marathi, this exquisite English translation paints a layered portrait of a troubled genius for whom art was not merely a thing of beauty but a vital part of living itself.'\n",
      " '\"During the time men live without a common Power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called Warre\"\\n\\nWritten during the turmoil of the English Civil War, Leviathan is an ambitious and highly original work of political philosophy. Claiming that man\\'s essential nature is competitive and selfish, Hobbes formulates the case for a powerful sovereign—or \"Leviathan\"—to enforce peace and the law, substituting security for the anarchic freedom he believed human beings would otherwise experience. This worldview shocked many of Hobbes\\'s contemporaries, and his work was publicly burnt for sedition and blasphemy when it was first published. But in his rejection of Aristotle\\'s view of man as a naturally social being, and in his painstaking analysis of the ways in which society can and should function, Hobbes opened up a whole new world of political science.\\n\\nBased on the original 1651 text, this edition incorporates Hobbes\\'s own corrections, while also retaining the original spelling and punctuation, to read with vividness and clarity. C. B. Macpherson\\'s introduction elucidates one of the most fascinating works of modern philosophy for the general reader.\\n\\nFor more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.'\n",

      "[\"A collection of entire body of work of the Sherlock Holmes Series by Arthur Conan Doyle, 'The Complete Sherlock Holmes: All 4 Novels and 56 Short Stories’ was published way back on October 1, 1986 by RHUS (Deluxe Edition). Since the complete works were published, the collection has only become more popular and has run into several editions after that. Sherlock Holmes is one of the most popular series in crime fiction.\\nAll the stories and novels in this book are centered around the famous sleuth Sherlock Holmes and how he solved even the most difficult cases with his remarkable observation techniques, reasoning abilities, towering intellect and knowledge of forensic science.\\nMany times, he even had to disguise himself to get to the underlying truth. Although most of his stories are narrated by his friend and biographer Dr. Watson, two had been narrated by Holmes himself while two other stories had been written in third person.\\nOften referred to as an 'eccentric’ and 'Bohemian’ by his friend Dr. Watson due to his inability to keep up with his personal hygiene and cleanliness, Holmes is known for trashing myths at a time when modern technologies were still a distant dream.\\nThe novels in this collection are The Valley of Fear, The Hound of the Baskervilles, The Sign of Four and A Study in Scarlet. The 56 stories have been divided into five books: the Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, the Return of Sherlock Holmes, the Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes and His Last Bow.\\nAbout the author:\\nA Scottish physician and an eminent writer, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s portrayal of Sherlock Holmes, a crime fiction icon in his detective series of the same name is known to be one of the path breaking and classical work in the history of English literature. Doyle’s body of work spans from science fiction and fantasy to poetry, plays, romance, historical novels and even non-fiction.\"\n",
      " 'Enhance your software deployment workflow using containers Key Features Get up-and-running with basic to advanced concepts of Docker Get acquainted with concepts such as Docker containers, Docker images, orchestrators and so on. Practical test-based approach to learning a prominent containerization tool Book DescriptionDocker containers have revolutionized the software supply chain in small and big enterprises. Never before has a new technology so rapidly penetrated the top 500 enterprises worldwide. Companies that embrace containers and containerize their traditional mission-critical applications have reported savings of at least 50% in total maintenance cost and a reduction of 90% (or more) of the time required to deploy new versions of those applications. Furthermore they are benefitting from increased security just by using containers as opposed to running applications outside containers. This book starts from scratch, introducing you to Docker fundamentals and setting up an environment to work with it. Then we delve into concepts such as Docker containers, Docker images, Docker Compose, and so on. We will also cover the concepts of deployment, orchestration, networking, and security. Furthermore, we explain Docker functionalities on public clouds such as AWS. By the end of this book, you will have hands-on experience working with Docker containers and orchestrators such as SwarmKit and Kubernetes. What you will learn Containerize your traditional or microservice-based application Share or ship your application as an immutable container image Build a Docker swarm and a Kubernetes cluster in the cloud Run a highly distributed application using Docker Swarm or Kubernetes Update or rollback a distributed application with zero downtime Secure your applications via encapsulation, networks, and secrets Know your options when deploying your containerized app into the cloud Who this book is forThis book is targeted at system administrators, operations engineers, DevOps engineers, and developers or stakeholders who are interested in getting started with Docker from scratch. No prior experience with Docker Containers is required.'\n",

      " \"Heinz Guderian - master of the Blitzkrieg and father of modern tank warfare - commanded the German XIX Army Corps as it rampaged across Poland in 1939. Personally leading the devastating attack which traversed the Ardennes Forest and broke through French lines, he was at the forefront of the race to the Channel coast. Only Hitler's personal command to halt prevented Guderian's tanks and troops turning Dunkirk into an Allied bloodbath. Later commanding Panzergruppe 2 in Operation Barbarossa, Guderian's armoured spearhead took Smolensk after fierce fighting and was poised to launch the final assault on Moscow when he was ordered south to Kiev. In the battle that followed, he helped encircle and capture over 600,000 Soviet troops after days of combat in the most terrible conditions. Panzer Leader is a searing firsthand account of the most effective fighting force in modern history by the man who commanded it.\"\n",
